UCB Data Analytics Boot Camp Module 4 Challenge


## Installation

Software Jupyter Notebook is being used to write the code, and to generate the results, and the environment is PythonData, provided by UC Berkeley.


## Description

This is the Module 4 challenge for the UC Berkeley Data Analyticd Boot Camp. In this assignment, we are the new Chief Data Scientist for our city's school district. We help the school board and mayor making strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

We were given data of the schools and the students, such as the school size, school budgets, students' math and reading scores, etc. With the data, we were able to analyse the test passing scores of the students against the school size, school budget, school types, etc., to help the authorities to decide on where they should be distributing their fundings to. It is found that the school budget does not directly connect to the performance of their students, and generally the larger the school size, the worse the performance. The analysis of the data is included in the Word document "Pandas-Challenge_Analysis".
